Majority of the Upregulated genes are associated with Immune response (Biological process) suggesting that immune response related genes are upregulated in the stage 1 tumor compared to Normal tissues
MAjority of the downregulated genes are associated with Channel transport function and hence suggesting these genes are suppressed in early stage pancreatic tumor compared to normal tissue.
These suggest that an increased immune response could be a possible biomarker for early detection of pancreatic cancer
